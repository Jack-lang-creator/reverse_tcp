Hi User, this is my first contribution in git this is a reverse_tcp script this is a user friendly script pretty straight forward. 

To make it work run the reverse_server.py in your machine and run the reverse_client.py in the victim's machine . You can inject the client script through meterpreter or social engineering that depends upon you.

Note that you have to change the ip in the script both for the server and the client , you can also change the port that's upto you.
In linux run 'ifconfig' in windows run 'ipconfig' to know your ip.

@Hacking is fun

More scripts are coming!!!!!!!!!!!!
